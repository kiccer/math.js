  This is a extension of Math object.<br>
  It inherits all attributes of Math object.<br>
  Math.js exists to enrich the functions of native Math objects,<br>
  And reduce the extra workload in actual development.<br>

```
In html
```html

```
In javascript

### What can it do?
You can view its functions through this [demo page](https://kiccer.github.io/math.js/).

Math.js makes the methods of native Math objects more flexible.

Methods like `Math.ceil`, `Math.floor`, `Math.round`, were originally reserved for integers only. But `math.js` allows them to keep decimal points.

`math.js` also provides some methods that do not exist in native `Math` objects. For example, finding the sum of arrays, or find the average value of a set of data.

The original intention of `math.js` is to maintain compactness, ensure the integrity of `Math` object methods, and expand the functions of Math object methods to achieve compatibility of methods.

If you think `math. js` can be better, please do what little one can to help.
